## Experience

### Open Source Developer

An open source contributor on GitHub account
[morinted](https://github.com/morinted).

- Original projects include:
    * a rolling log implementation for AngularJS paired with Cordova, with a
      focus on using promises (futures) for asynchronous code.
    * a schedule generator for the University of Ottawa. This Java project used
      a UML code generator for its core data structures, has a Swing/AWT GUI,
      draws on a Canvas, and uses a client/server architecture. The web scraping
      component is made up of two Python scripts. One is a selenium web-driver
      job that explores the uOttawa website to grab all the course names, and
      the second is a multi-threaded script to grab the course
      details, and parses the data with Beautiful Soup and RegEx.
- Developed features and fixed bugs for Plover, open source stenography software
  written in Python.
- Submitted bug reports with follow-up for the Ionic framework and the Ionic
  keyboard.

### Telepin Software

#### Mobile Application Developer

*May 2014 to April 2015*

Built a mobile application for mobile transactions using the Ionic framework.

- Created a mobile application in Ionic with a team, and carried it through
  design, development, and into user acceptance testing.
- Practiced test driven development with an end-to-end and unit test suite to
  ensure that the application was always customer-ready.
- Performed and received code reviews using Gerrit.
- Tracked issues and development goals with Atlassian Jira.
- Wrote documentation in Atlassian Confluence for the application for future
  developers, including guides for environment setup and design documents
  explaining major decisions.
- Conducted the JavaScript portion of interviews for development positions and
  aided in selecting candidates.

### Citizenship & Immigration Canada

#### GCMS Automated Tester

*May 2013 to August 2013*

- Ensured new builds of the GCMS were functional and fast, using automated
  tests.
- Redesigned the test-running Java GUI to be more concise by reducing clutter
  and predicting user action.
- Automated the running of the regression test suite using an AutoHotKey script
  to retrieve tests from a queue held on the intranet, then running the tests on
  up to seven computers at once. This reduced the time it took to run a
  regression test of a build to half of that of a manual run, and only required
  one member of the team.
- Created VBA macro-enabled Excel spreadsheets to automate manual tasks that the
  team had been assigned.

### RB Computing Inc.

#### Computer Technician and Sales

*July 2011 to present day*

- Build, sell, diagnose, and repair Windows PCs.
- Compile the bi-weekly newsletter.

  tasks, such as verifying that a list of products exist on the website.
