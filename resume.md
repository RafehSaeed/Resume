    * a schedule generator for the University of Ottawa. This Java project used
      a UML code generator for its core data structures, has a Swing/AWT GUI,
      draws on a Canvas, and uses a client/server architecture. The web scraping
      component is made up of two Python scripts. One is a selenium web-driver
      job that explores the uOttawa website to grab all the course names, and
      the second is a multi-threaded script to grab the course
      details, and parses the data with Beautiful Soup and RegEx.
