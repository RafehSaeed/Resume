<h2>About Ted</h2>

<p>A University of Ottawa co-op student studying to be a software engineer, with a
strong interest in web technologies. Enthusiastic about the industry, and
excited to work on projects that have a big impact on people&#39;s lives.
Programming is a passion. Clean, efficient, and understandable code is
personally important, regardless of the project. Prefer working with a team in a
position that allows for growth and learning.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<h3>BASc in Software Engineering, CO-OP</h3>

<h4>University of Ottawa</h4>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3>Open Source Developer</h3>

<p>An open source contributor on GitHub account
<a href="https://github.com/morinted">morinted</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Original projects include:

<ul>
<li>a rolling log implementation for AngularJS paired with Cordova, with a
focus on using promises (futures) for synchronous code.</li>
<li>a schedule generator for the University of Ottawa. This Java project used
a UML code generator for its core data structures, has a Swing/AWT GUI,
draws on a Canvas, and uses a client/server architecture. The web scraping
component is made up of two Python scripts. One is a selenium web-driver
job that explores the uOttawa website to grab all the course names, and
the second is a multi-threaded script to grab the course
details, and parses the data with Beautiful Soup and RegEx.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Developed features and fixed bugs for Plover, open source stenography software
written in Python.</li>
<li>Submitted bug reports with follow-up for the Ionic framework and the Ionic
keyboard.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Telepin Software</h3>

<h4>Mobile Application Developer</h4>

<p><em>May 2014 to April 2015</em></p>

design, development, and into user acceptance testing.</li>
<li>Practiced test driven development with an end-to-end and unit test suite to
ensure that the application was always customer-ready.</li>
<li>Performed and received code reviews using Gerrit.</li>
