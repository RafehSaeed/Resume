<h2>Technical Skills</h2>

<h3>Technologies</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ionic Framework:</strong> More than 8 months full-time experience working with the
Ionic framework, a framework employing <strong>AngularJS</strong>, <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, and
<strong>Cordova</strong> in order to create native-like cross-platform mobile applications.
Tasks included creating an application with dozens of different features,
along with creating a test-suite for regression and unit testing.</li>

most school assignments. Practice object-oriented programming when
architecting Java projects. Experience creating GUIs in Swing/AWT. </li>
<li><strong>Python:</strong> Used Python quite a few times, usually to automate personal and
minor work tasks, as it is a clean and effective functional language.</li>
<li>Other technologies used include <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>
(object-oriented course work), <strong>VBA</strong> (Excel macros), and <strong>VB.NET</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools</h3>

in OSX.</li>
<li>Adept with terminal Git, and experience using web services such as GitHub and
Git bucket.</li>
<li>Experience with Atlassian Jira and GitHub as issue tracking systems.</li>
<li>Favorite developer tools include Sublime Text, IBM Eclipse, and IDEA IDEs.</li>
<li>Use of Pandoc and Markdown for near all text work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use of test-driven development while coding.</li>
<li>Experience running targeted regression tests for priority, time-sensitive
testing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Database</h3>

<ul>
<li>Familiar with designing and normalizing databases through course work and
assignments.</li>
<li>Use of databases to solve problems, such as in the uOttawa schedule generator.</li>
<li>Use of PostgreSQL and MongoDB while developing course assignments.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Design</h3>

<ul>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3>Open Source Developer</h3>

<p>An open source contributer on GitHub account
<a href="https://github.com/morinted">morinted</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Contributions made for various projects, including pull-requests and bug
reports. Pull-requests for original features made for Plover, open source
stenography software; and bug reports with follow-up for the Ionic framework.</li>
<li>Original projects include:

<ul>
<li>a rolling log implementation for AngularJS paired with Cordova, with a
focus on using promises (futures) for synchronous code.</li>
<li>a schedule generator for the University of Ottawa. This Java project used
a UML code generator for its core data structures, has a Swing/AWT GUI,
draws on a Canvas, and uses a client/server architecture. The web scraping
component is made up of two Python scripts. One is a selenium web-driver
job that explores the uOttawa website to grab all the course names, and
the second is a multi-threaded Beautiful Soup script to grab the course
details, with some RegEx as well.</li>
