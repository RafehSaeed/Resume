<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I am a software developer with an interest in communication and design. I enjoy experimenting with new things to expand my knowledge and I believe that creating ways for people to share knowledge is one of the greatest goals for mankind. </p>

<p>I am an Eagle Scout and in my free time I enjoy contributing to open source projects, hiking, reading and listening to music.</p>

<p>My goal is to obtain a software development job at a small company, focusing on launching and building software for the web.</p>

<h2>Proficiency</h2>

<p>I have been writing code, running servers and experimenting with new software since 2002. Most recently the majority of code I have written has been in Java, Ruby, Python and Bash, but I have experience in PHP, Javascript, Go, C, SML/NJ, SQL and F#.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<h4>Site Reliability Engineer - April 2012 to Present</h4>

<p>I currently work as an SRE for Google Compute Engine in London. My job includes being part of an oncall rotation and writing software to maintain, monitor and optimize hundreds of thousands of servers globally. I also spend a decent amount of time analyzing processes used by the teams I work closely with to try and automate people out of a job, myself included. If you are unfamiliar with SRE, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_engineering">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://googleforstudents.blogspot.com/2012/06/site-reliability-engineers-worlds-most.html">Google&#39;s blog</a>.</p>

<p>In the past I worked in San Francisco, CA on Google Cloud Storage and Google Compute Engine, doing similar things to what I do now.</p>

Once at Google I continued to maintain Punchd&#39;s servers, backend API and web frontend. I also helped implement a version of Punchd built on Google&#39;s infrastructure, but it was never released.</p>
