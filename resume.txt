## Technical Skills

### Technologies

- **Ionic Framework:** More than 8 months full-time experience working with the
  Ionic framework, a framework employing **AngularJS**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and
  **Cordova** in order to create native-like cross-platform mobile applications.
  Tasks included creating an application with dozens of different features,
  along with creating a test-suite for regression and unit testing.
- **Java:** Used Java to create my schedule generator on GitHub, as well as
  most school assignments. Practice object-oriented programming when
  architecting Java projects. Experience creating GUIs in Swing/AWT. 
- **Python:** Used Python quite a few times, usually to automate personal and
  minor work tasks, as it is a clean and effective functional language.
- Other technologies used include **jQuery**, **Node.js**, **C++**
  (object-oriented course work), **VBA** (Excel macros), and **VB.NET**.

### Tools

- Most comfortable in Linux and Windows for development, with some experience
  in OSX.
- Adept with terminal Git, and experience using web services such as GitHub and
  Git bucket.
- Experience with Atlassian Jira and GitHub as issue tracking systems.
- Favorite developer tools include Sublime Text, IBM Eclipse, and IDEA IDEs.
- Use of Pandoc and Markdown for near all text work.

### Testing

- Use of test-driven development while coding.
- Experience running targeted regression tests for priority, time-sensitive
  testing.

### Database

- Familiar with designing and normalizing databases through course work and
  assignments.
- Use of databases to solve problems, such as in the uOttawa schedule generator.
- Use of PostgreSQL and MongoDB while developing course assignments.

### Design

- Website design skills using HTML5 and CSS3, including creating new
  style-sheets for existing websites as a hobby.
- Use of Ionic Framework to develop a cross-platform application using web
  technologies.
- Adobe Creative Suite experience, including extensive Photoshop skills.

## Experience

### Open Source Developer

An open source contributer on GitHub account
[morinted](https://github.com/morinted).

- Contributions made for various projects, including pull-requests and bug
  reports. Pull-requests for original features made for Plover, open source
  stenography software; and bug reports with follow-up for the Ionic framework.
- Original projects include:
    * a rolling log implementation for AngularJS paired with Cordova, with a
      focus on using promises (futures) for synchronous code.
    * a schedule generator for the University of Ottawa. This Java project used
      a UML code generator for its core data structures, has a Swing/AWT GUI,
      draws on a Canvas, and uses a client/server architecture. The web scraping
      component is made up of two Python scripts. One is a selenium web-driver
      job that explores the uOttawa website to grab all the course names, and
      the second is a multi-threaded Beautiful Soup script to grab the course
      details, with some RegEx as well.

### Telepin Software

#### Mobile Application Developer

*May 2014 to April 2015*

Built a mobile application for mobile transactions using the Ionic framework.
 
- An e2e and unit test suite were built during test-driven development.
- Use of code reviews while working in a small team.
- Wrote the application from scratch, and carried it through a design phase into
  a user-acceptance testing maintenance phase.
- Wrote documentation for the application for future developers.

### Citizenship & Immigration Canada

#### GCMS Automated Tester

*May 2013 to August 2013*

- Ran automated tests for regression testing.
- Rewrote the Java GUI to be more concise.
